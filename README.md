<h1 align="center"> ISENW <br> Image Search Engine using Neural networks and Web scrapping </h1>

<br />
A web app which generates the information about an object image. The concept of Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNN ) Architecture is used to build the model which detects the object from the image based on the features and generates the information of it.
<br> 
Some of tools used in this project are :

* Python <br>
* Django Framework <br>
* Keras <br>
* Tensorflow <br>
* Pretrained Models <br>
* OpenCV
